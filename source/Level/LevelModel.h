* This class is a subclass of Asset so that we can use it with a GenericLoader. As with

* methods. Assets should be treated as if they load in parallel, not in sequence.  Therefore,
* it is unsafe to assume that one asset loads before another.  If this level needs to connect
* to other assets (sound, images, etc.) this should take place after asset loading, such as
